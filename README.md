# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

# Unit 03: JavaScript

## Overview
We’ve reached an important milestone in our journey: learning to code. This unit will introduce you to the fundamental programming concepts that are required to solve any computational problem. Though the focus of this course is JavaScript, the programming concepts you learn can be applied to any programming language. After you master JavaScript, it will be relatively easy to learn a second (or third or fourth) language.

In order for our web applications to be interactive, we need a way to respond to user actions in the browser. That's where JavaScript comes in. JavaScript is _the_ programming language of the web. It allows us to dynamically generate HTML and CSS based on predetermined conditions or user input. And every major browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, ships with a built-in JavaScript engine that runs our code for us. 

For the time being, we'll use JavaScript to write client-side code; that is, programs that only run in the browser. In later units, we'll use JavaScript to write applications to be run and deployed on servers.

Starting this week, we are going to begin providing weekly algorithm problems for you to work on. Go through each problem according to the schedule outlined below. Spend up to a few hours trying to solve each problem without looking at the solution. If you're unable to solve a problem, study the solution to understand why it works then come back and try again later. Ask your instructional staff for help during office hours if you're having trouble understanding anything.

### Part Time Schedule

* **Week 3** - Problems 1 - 5

* **Week 4** - Problems 6 - 9

* **Week 5** - Problems 10 - 13

* **Week 6** - Problems 14 - 17

* **Week 7** - Problems 18 - 21

### Full Time Schedule

* **Week 2** - Problems 1 - 9

* **Week 3** - Problems 10 - 17

* **Week 4** - Problems 18 - 21

## Key Topics
The following topics are covered in this unit:
* Code comments
* Console
* Variables
* Data types
* Booleans
* Numbers
* Strings
* Arrays
* Conditional statements
* Equality
* Logical, comparison, and ternary operators
* for and while loops
* Functions
* Alerts, prompts, and confirms
* Global vs. local scope
* Objects

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What are five fundamental concepts of programming?
2. What are objects in JavaScript and why are they important?
3. What is a function?


## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Identify and declare variables containing primitive and object data types in JavaScript
* Write for loops to iterate over strings and arrays
* Write conditional statements using if/else and switch
* Explain the importance of objects in JavaScript and create objects containing both properties and methods
* Explain and implement the difference between function declarations and expressions
* Explain and implement comparison and logical operators

## Algorithms

* 01-arithmetic - Create functions capable of different arithmetic operations.

* 02-odd-or-even - Create a function that determines whether a number is odd or even.

* 03-log-nums - Create a function that prints all whole numbers from 1 to a given number.

## Homework: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.
